This app is for the user to input the coffee shop that they go to with all of its details,
then to rate individually that coffee shops coffee and food.

I created it as I moved to Cape Town over a while ago and as I walk through town I often frequent
different coffee shops, however I also forget which ones had the best coffee/food if I wanted to go to them
again. So, out of a neccesity to me this is the reason behind my app.

In the database that I have included in the folder it stores a list of coffee shops in cape town, with
the correct details and their ratings.


How to use:
The user inputs the name of coffee shop, on clicking add they are then taken to a dialogbox
which asks for input of the shop details. Once this is done the shop can be selected from
the dropdown, once selected the user can rate the coffee or food using the rating buttons.

The user can also delete, view a single shop or view all the shops using the specific buttons.
